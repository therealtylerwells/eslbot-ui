This is in progress. It's a job search UI. You can search a combination of external "scraped" jobs and internally posted jobs, post jobs, apply for jobs, create an account, track your posted jobs, and more. Our API lives in eslbot-api. Our web scraper lives in a private repo, but I'd share that if you're interested.

## Highighted tech

Want to try? All you need to do is npm install and npm start. The app will connect with the already-running database + API.
